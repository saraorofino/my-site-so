Sara Orofino is a recent graduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara where she specialized in Coastal Marine Resource Management and Environmental Data Science. Her two graduate research areas focused on evaluating strategies for better managing data-poor fisheries in the face of climate change and studying factors that make communities more resilient to natural disasters. Currently, she is working as an Ocean Health Index Fellow with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.
